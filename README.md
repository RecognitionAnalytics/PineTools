# PineTools

PineTools is a Python-based toolkit designed to load and analyze exported AfterMath files from the Pine BiPotentiostat. This repository provides functionality for handling and performing basic analysis of electrochemical experiments, including:

- Cyclic Voltammetry (CV)
- Dual Electrode Cyclic Voltammetry (DECV)

## Features

- **File Loading**: Seamlessly import AfterMath-exported files for analysis.
- **Data Manipulation**: Tools to preprocess and clean experimental data.
- **Electrochemical Analysis**: Perform basic analysis of CV and DECV experiments to extract key electrochemical properties.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions in the documentation.
